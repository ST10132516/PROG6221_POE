How to Compile and Run a C# Program Built Using Visual Studio
1. Open Visual Studio and open the solution containing your C# project.

2. Build your project by selecting "Build" from the main menu and then choosing "Build Solution" or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B. This will compile your project and generate an executable file.

3. Once the build process is completed successfully, locate the executable file. By default, it should be in the bin/Debug or bin/Release folder within your project directory. The name of the executable file should match the name of your project.

4. Double-click on the executable file to run it. Alternatively, you can run it from the command prompt by navigating to the directory containing the executable file and entering its name.

5. Follow the prompts displayed on the console.

6. Once your program has finished running, it will exit automatically or require you to press a key to exit the console application.
